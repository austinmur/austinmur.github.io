<p> Hi thank you for taking the time to read this. I have never done this before just like maybe most if not all of you. Some of you might have never learned about HTML before and it might be a little difficult at first. I was in the same boat a few days ago. It just takes memorizing a few things and then looking at the website to learn to ways to change your website. Just learn it one command at a time.
